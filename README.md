# 📱 Mobile Plan Recommendation with Machine Learning  

Machine Learning classification project for Megaline mobile company. Developed a model to predict and recommend the best plan (Smart or Ultra) based on customer behavior, with a target accuracy of 0.75.

✅ Español: Proyecto de clasificación con Machine Learning para recomendar el mejor plan móvil (Smart o Ultra) en Megaline, con una exactitud mínima objetivo del 75%.  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Sprint 9: Introduction to Machine Learning** module at TripleTen Latam.  
The task was to support the mobile company **Megaline**, which wanted to encourage customers to switch from legacy plans to new ones. The goal was to build a **classification model** that recommends the appropriate plan — **Smart** or **Ultra** — based on customer behavior.

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed  
- Used customer behavioral data (calls, messages, internet usage).  
- Split dataset into **training, validation, and test sets**.  
- Trained multiple classification models:  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Logistic Regression  
- Evaluated models with accuracy scores.  
- Selected the **best-performing model** that achieved the required threshold (≥ 0.75).

## 📂 Dataset Description  
The dataset contained anonymized customer usage data:  
- `calls`: number and duration of calls.  
- `messages`: number of SMS sent.  
- `mb_used`: internet data usage in MB.  
- `plan`: target variable (Smart or Ultra).

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (DecisionTree, RandomForest, LogisticRegression)  
- Model evaluation and accuracy metrics  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Built and tested multiple ML models for plan recommendation.  
- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy above the 0.75 threshold.  
- Provided a reliable classification tool to support **customer plan migration**.
